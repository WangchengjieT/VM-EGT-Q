# VM-EGT-Q
source code for: 
Effect of Q-learning on the evolution of cooperation behavior in collective motion: An improved Vicsek model,
submitted to Applied Mathematics and Computation (202404)

written in matlab, 
two execution files: vicsek_origin.m, main_parallel.m
several custom functions: others

simulation_Q.m: the main method of VM-EGT-Q is implemented in the function
simulation_evolution_early_stop.m: the main method of VM-EGT is implemented in the function

run main_parallel.m to get the data for plotting, the sample data: vicsek_reinforcement_eta_2402.csv
